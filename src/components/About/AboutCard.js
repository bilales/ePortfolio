            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Bilal Azdad </span>
            <br />I graduated as a computer science engineer student from
            INP-ENSEEIHT specializing in Image and Multimedia. Interested in
            Artificial Intelligence, Data science and Computer vision because of
            the mixture of applied mathematics, image processing, data analysis
            and software engineering. My curiosity towards science and new
            technologies is growing and supports my engagement to broaden my
            knowledge and build my skills.
            <br />

            This portfolio seeks to best convey my character, my professional
            trajectory, and my future goals. You can find information about my
            experiences, initiatives, and skills, both professionally and
            personally. Please get in touch with me if you want additional
            information about my experience or the projects I worked on.
